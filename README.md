HALAGA حلقة

Intoduction

As the educational field seeks for a technological solution that will link school and student parents , the main objective of “Halaga” is to act as a bridge between the two parties as it is crucial that parents participate in their children's learning at an early stage, improving their study outcomes as a consequence.Until recently, communication methods have been prone to many issues and mistakes. School administrators and parents are not provided with an adequate technological solution. 

“Halaga” benefits both schools and parents, as it allows them to upload any documents that have to be reviewed, approved, or filled by parents, as well as publish planned activities or events. Teachers will be able to broadcast a unified message to all students’ parents. A private chat can be used by the school and the parents during specified office hours to facilitate direct communication. Parents can notify the school when they arrive to pick up their children. Parents are informed if their child is absent; they can upload medical or personal records to clarify the absence. 



Technology

We will use Flutter which supports cross platform development for different operating systems. The project will need a database to store the user’s information which will be handled by Firebase and PHP on the server side of the application. The project will be developed and managed by Jira, Git, Github, Android studio, Visual Studio, XCode, Google Chrome and any other software that we might acquire during the development process.
