# Halaqa - حلقة
### a web based application that target schools and student parents, who need a means of easier communication methods between them.


## Introduction

  As the educational field seeks for a technological solution that will link school and student parents , the main objective of “Halaqa” is to act as a bridge between the two parties as it is crucial that parents participate in their children's learning at an early stage, improving their study outcomes as a consequence.Until recently, communication methods have been prone to many issues and mistakes. School administrators and parents are not provided with an adequate technological solution. 

  "Halaqa" is an Arabic web based application. That will provide several features that focuses on enhancing the communication and the pickup methods between the school faculty and the students’ parents.
  our project aims to provide a single platform that combines most of the different features that other applications provide to aid the communication between the two parties and easing and organizing the pickup methods in the school.
